Hey! I'm Sirena Alyce. Welcome to my blog!

## Meet Sirena Alyce

Why does my blog have Credibility?

BS in Biology

MPH with concentration in Epidemiology

4+ years in public health

4+ years as a data manager and SAS programmer for a clinical trials company

NuCamp Bootcamp Full Stack and Mobile App Developer Graduate (currently freelancing)

Current Data Analyst III for a top telecommunications company in Atlanta, GA.

I’ve had quite a career journey.

How did your site get started?

Started as a portfolio to share my development projects to potential employers and recruiters. I wanted to expand the site to include a blog to practice my developer skills and learn a new technology (Next.js). Once I got the blog developed, I realized that eventually I would need to actually post content and this would be a great way to document my journey. I knew I wanted the content to be useful and …. because…. I also know that I wanted my content to make an impact, whether small or large, on the STEM industries/fields. It is well known that women of color are highly underrepresented in STEM fields \*\*\*inserts stats\*\*\*. This platform is a way to help increase that representation through exposure to the opportunities available. I also have a vision that this blog will grow into a beautiful, thriving community of amazing women who are focused on supporting and encouraging other women of color. Additionally, and admittedly selfishly, \*\*\*insert a meme\*\*\* I am using this blog as a way to continue to learn and test out what I learn through practice and teaching. I figured if I can teach it, and teach it well, then I can confidently say I know it.
