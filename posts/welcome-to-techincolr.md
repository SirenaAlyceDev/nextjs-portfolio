Hi there! Sirena Alyce here. I'd like to welcome you to my blog!

<div style="width:100%;height:0;padding-bottom:100%;position:relative;"><iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/3o7btV5GAWaGkwjTrO" width="100%" height="100%" style="position:absolute" frameBorder="0" class="giphy-embed" allowFullScreen></iframe></div><p><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/reactionseditor-3o7btV5GAWaGkwjTrO">via GIPHY</a></p>

## Meet Sirena Alyce

First, I'd like to tell you a little bit about myself…

I am a St. Louis girl with a very non-traditional route into tech. A nail polish business is actually what led me to become interested in tech (specifically programming and development). I discovered that I liked building the website and learning the platform (I was using WordPress at the time), a whole lot more than I actually liked the business. It has been my goal to learn more and more about tech ever since.

My career journey has been quite interesting as well. I graduated from Spelman College in 2012 with a BS in Biology. Then in 2016, I graduated with a Masters in Public Health with a concentration in Epidemiology. As a former CDC employee with 4+ years of experience in public health, I know a lot about public health. Also, I have 4+ years' experience in the field of clinical trials as a data manager and SAS programmer. Recently, I graduated from NuCamp’s Full Stack and Mobile App Developer Bootcamp (currently building my freelancing business). As of right now, I am the Data Analyst for a top telecommunications company in Atlanta, GA.

## The Blog & The Vision

Are you a woman of color interested in pursuing a career in tech? Look no further.

Love data, design, or development? This is where you should be!

<div style="width:100%;height:0;padding-bottom:56%;position:relative;"><iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/f0rPFeXM19PI4" width="100%" height="100%" style="position:absolute" frameBorder="0" class="giphy-embed" allowFullScreen></iframe></div><p><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/ShalitaGrant-point-pointing-f0rPFeXM19PI4">via GIPHY</a></p>SirenaAlyce.com started as a portfolio site to showcase my development projects to recruiters and employers. I decided to incorporate a blog into the site while I was building it to practice my skills and learn a new framework (Next.js). This is how Techincolr, the blog, started. Once I created the blog, I realized I would eventually have to start posting content and this would serve as a good platform to do that. 

Whether the impact is small or large, I knew I wanted the content to have a purpose. There is no doubt that women of color are underrepresented in the data and technology fields.  While the representation of women has improved in some STEM professions, there is still a long way to go in the area of engineering and computer science. Women of color held 11.5% of science and engineering roles in the United States in 2017, according to catalyst.org. [Census.gov](https://www.census.gov/library/stories/2021/01/women-making-gains-in-stem-occupations-but-still-underrepresented.html) shows that “Women working in engineering occupations increased from 3% in 1970 to 15% in 2019. And while the percentage of women in computer occupations is higher than in 1970, it actually decreased between 1990 and 2019.” I want to use his platform as a way to help increase that representation.

The content on the blog will be a mix of industry insights and current news, learning resources, career advice and resources, insights from subject matter experts, and inspirational posts. 

Ultimately, I want this blog to grow into a vibrant community of creative, intelligent, amazing women!
