Hi there! Sirena Alyce here. I'd like to welcome you to my blog!

<div style="width:100%;height:0;padding-bottom:100%;position:relative;"><iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/3o7btV5GAWaGkwjTrO" width="100%" height="100%" style="position:absolute" frameBorder="0" class="giphy-embed" allowFullScreen></iframe></div><p><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/reactionseditor-3o7btV5GAWaGkwjTrO">via GIPHY</a></p>Meet Sirena Alyce

First, I'd like to tell you a little bit about myself…

I am a St. Louis girl with a very non-traditional route into tech. A nail polish business is actually what led me to become interested in tech (specifically programming and development). I discovered that I liked building the website and learning the platform (I was using WordPress at the time), a whole lot more than I actually liked the business. It has been my goal to learn more and more about tech ever since.

My career journey has been quite interesting as well. I graduated from Spelman College in 2012 with a BS in Biology. Then in 2016, I graduated with a Masters in Public Health with a concentration in Epidemiology. As a former CDC employee with 4+ years of experience in public health, I know a lot about public health. Also, I have 4+ years' experience in the field of clinical trials as a data manager and SAS programmer. Recently, I graduated from NuCamp’s Full Stack and Mobile App Developer Bootcamp (currently building my freelancing business). As of right now, I am the Data Analyst for a top telecommunications company in Atlanta, GA.

SirenaAlyce.com was set up as a portfolio site to showcase my development projects to recruiters and employers. I decided to incorporate a blog into the site while I was building it to practice my skills and learn a new framework (Next.js). This is how Techincolr started. Once I created the blog, I realized I would eventually have to start posting stories and this would serve as a good platform to do that. 

I knew I wanted the content to be useful and …. because…. I also know that I wanted my content to make an impact, whether small or large, on the STEM industries/fields. It is well known that women of color are highly underrepresented in STEM fields \*\*\*inserts stats\*\*\*. This platform is a way to help increase that representation through exposure to the opportunities available. I also have a vision that this blog will grow into a beautiful, thriving community of amazing women who are focused on supporting and encouraging other women of color. Additionally, and admittedly selfishly, \*\*\*insert a meme\*\*\* I am using this blog as a way to continue to learn and test out what I learn through practice and teaching. I figured if I can teach it, and teach it well, then I can confidently say I know it.

## The Blog & The Vision

Are you a woman of color interested in pursuing a career in STEM? Look no further.

Love data, design, or development? This is where you should be.

The content on the blog will be a mix of industry insights and current news, learning resources, career advice and resources, insights from subject matter experts, and inspirational posts. 

Ultimately, I want this blog to grow into a vibrant community of creative, intelligent, amazing women!
