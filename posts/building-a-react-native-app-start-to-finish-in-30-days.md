This challenge is inspired by instamobile.com's [10 Best React Native App Ideas for Beginners](https://www.instamobile.io/react-native-tutorials/react-native-app-ideas-beginners/) blog post. I want to create a react native app from start to finish in 30 days.

What is React Native?

Day 1:

I reviewed the blog post and picked a project - the events planner app.

I reviewed the suggested features that can be implemented as a beginner. I will stick with the suggested features for now. 

I looked for front end inspiration on [dribbble.com](https://dribbble.com/shots) and found a couple shots that I liked. 

I want to keep the front end very simple and clean.

Day 2:

Set up environment and folder structure.
